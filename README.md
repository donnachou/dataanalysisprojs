# Music Streaming Data Analysis Project ðŸŽµ
This project is focused on analyzing streaming data from various platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Pandora, TikTok, etc.) to uncover insights into popular songs, artists, and trends. Using a rich dataset of streaming statistics, playlist counts, and song metadata, we perform in-depth analysis to answer critical questions like:

Top-streamed songs across platforms ðŸŽ§
Artists with the most listeners ðŸŽ¤
Trends in listener engagement and growth ðŸ“ˆ
Songs released in specific years and their performance over time ðŸ“…

Key Features
Multi-platform comparison: Analyze how songs perform across different streaming services (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.).
Time-based analysis: Track trends over time, such as songs released in 2024 or changes in playlist reach.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handle missing and null values, convert string-based metrics (like streams) into integers for accurate analysis.
Optimized Queries: Efficient SQL queries designed for platforms like Tinybird to handle large datasets and provide insights quickly.

Technologies
SQL: For querying and analyzing large datasets.
Tinybird: For fast data processing and analytics.
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

Use Cases
Music Producers/Artists: Track how songs are performing across different platforms.
Music Streaming Companies: Analyze listener engagement and optimize playlist strategies.
